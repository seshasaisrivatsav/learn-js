-------------
HTML5 introducted inline blocks.
twitter bootstrap
bootstrap = not native to your browser
flexbox = natively available in the newer browsers. 
CSS grid = competitor to flexbox


start with blocks and in line blocks

If you can build a layout

<div>
asdas
</div>

// it has display: block by default

<p>
asd
</p>
// it has display block, margins and stuff


what are the blocks in css?
paragraph, div

computed
--------
it's also kind of default

css is global.
There are solutions to it. 

padding
-------
what every is padding inside div, add 2px to it
<div style="padding;2px; border: 1px solid green">hi</div>

added inside.

margin
------
added outside. between itself and next element 

<p>hi<p> default font size is 16; but when you inspect it, it shows 18. as it adds 1px on top and bottom.


What is a border box?
Content and padding around it and a border around it.

hook/selector
--------------
1. class
connecting html and css
<div class = "test">hi</div>
css
.test {
    border: 1px solid red;
}


2. id
<div id = "myId>hi </div>

#myId {
    background-color: brown;
}

ids are supposed to be unique. 
classes can be used multiple times.

3. attribute
class and id are attributes
<div sesha=""> hi</div>

in css
[sesha] {
    background-color:white;
}


specificity: when conflicting styles are applied to same elements, based on priority, called specificity, it goes.
Eg: id and attribute conflict, id is given first priority as it is unique.


id can be used for css and JS both

<div myName = "test1"> h11 </div>

<div myName = "test2"> h11 </div>


css

[myName = "test1" ] {
asdfsdf
}
[myname = "test2] {
asyjuk
}


these are also called selector/hook

combination
------------
applying combination of selectors to a style
.className#myID{
    background-color: black
}
